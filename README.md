# Functional Specification

We plan to make a website like _Blocket_ or _Tradera_ were a user can create an account and log in via a registered account on the site or by using a Google account. Users can use the sites functions of adding items for sale or browsing for other items to buy from other users.
These items will be added to a dataset that we create to keep track of everything on the site.

# Technical Specification

The site will be made using **React and Redux** for the client-side along with **Webpack** to bundle the code to one minified output file.

**Node.js** **Express.js** will be used for the backend.

For later, testing will be done using **Jest**, maybe along with **Enzyme**.
