We plan to make a website were a user can create an account and log in to use the sites functions of adding items for sale for example.
These items will be added to a dataset that we create to keep track of everything on the site.

The site will be made using React and Redux for the client-side along with Webpack to bundle the code to one minified output file.

Express through Node will be used as backend to manage datasets.

For later testing Jest will be used, maybe along with Enzyme.
