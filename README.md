We plan to make a website were a user can create an account and log in to use the sites functions of adding items for sale for example.
These items will be added to a dataset that we create to keep track of everything on the site. 

The site will be made using react and redux for the client-side and RESTlike backend to access datasets. 
For later testing Grunt will be used as taskrunner to make these.
